This package (legistarnyc) is a vendored FORK of [python-legistar-scraper](https://github.com/opencivicdata/python-legistar-scraper).

The original package is relatively unmaintained, with a number of bugs that don't work perfectly for the NYC market.

For that reason, we decided to vendor the whole package and maintain a version locally in this NYC-specific project, rather than maintain a NYC-specific fork that we post to pypi, which might create confusion.

Major thanks to the contributors of `python-legistar-scraper` for their hard work and their scraper template.
